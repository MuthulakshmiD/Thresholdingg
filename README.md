# THRESHOLDING
## Aim
To segment the image using global thresholding, adaptive thresholding and Otsu's thresholding using python and OpenCV.

## Software Required
1. Anaconda - Python 3.7
2. OpenCV

## Algorithm

### Step1:
Import required libraries.

### Step2:
Read the image and convert it to grayscale then display it.

### Step3:
Use Global thresholding to segment the image

### Step4:
Use Adaptive thresholding to segment the image

### Step5:
Use Otsu's method to segment the image 

### Step6:
End the program.


## Result
Thus the images are segmented using global thresholding, adaptive thresholding and optimum global thresholding using python and OpenCV.
